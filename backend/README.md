# Agro Zanjir Digital — backend

Django 6 + DRF. The middle band of the architecture: the lot registry, the
event log, the six clusters that hang off it, and the ports that make all of it
legible to banks, insurers, carriers and customs.

## Run it

```sh
cp .env.example .env            # optional; the shell boots without one
.venv/bin/python manage.py migrate
.venv/bin/python manage.py seed_reference     # capabilities, roles, org types, checks
.venv/bin/python manage.py seed_demo          # the pilot demonstration dataset
.venv/bin/python manage.py seed_accounts      # the people, and their passwords
.venv/bin/python manage.py runserver 8000
```

`seed_accounts` creates the pilot's people - three to six roles at each kind of
organisation - and prints their passwords once. It is idempotent and never
deletes anything; `--rotate` issues new passwords, `--password X` sets one
shared password for a demonstration on a laptop.

`seed_reference` is not demo data — it is the product's own catalogues (ten
capabilities, thirty-seven roles, thirteen organisation types, six verification
checks) and every deployment needs it. `seed_demo` is the pilot dataset the
panels were designed against; `--reset` replaces it.

| URL | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `/api/v1/health/` | liveness + database check (open, no auth) |
| `/api/docs/` | Swagger UI over the generated OpenAPI schema |
| `/api/schema/` | the schema itself — the web client generates its API layer from this |
| `/admin/` | the operator admin, which is also the manual-adapter surface |
| `/api/v1/assistant/` | whether the website's assistant is connected (open, no auth) |

```sh
.venv/bin/python manage.py test          # 87 tests
.venv/bin/python manage.py spectacular --file schema.yml   # dump the spec
```

## The model

```
apps/common/      base models (UUID pk, timestamps, money), notifications
apps/registry/    ORIGIN     — User, Party, OrganisationType, Capability, Role,
                               Membership, VerificationCheck, PartyVerification,
                               Product, Farm, ProductionPlan

apps/quality/     QUALITY    — QcRecord, PilotTrial, TrialArm, TrialObservation
apps/storage/     STORAGE    — Facility, StorageZone, GateArrival,
                               StoragePlacement, ConditionReading,
                               ConditionExcursion
apps/commercial/  COMMERCIAL — OfftakeContract, ExportContract, PriceTerm,

apps/assistant/   no tables: the two assistants, public and operator
ports/            LenderPort, InsurerPort, CarrierPort, CustomsPort, SensorPort
```

Each `models.py` opens with what its cluster owns and why its shapes are what
they are. Four of the root README's rules are enforced in code, not by
convention:

1. **The log is the truth.** `LotEvent.save()` refuses a second write,
   `delete()` refuses outright, and each row's SHA-256 covers the previous
   row's — so an edit that dodges the ORM still breaks the chain from that
   point on. `GET /api/v1/lots/{code}/verify-chain/` recomputes it.
2. **Encumbrance is an overlay, not a status.** There is no `pledged` in
   `Lot.Status`. `finance` registers a guard with the spine in `apps.py`, the
   spine asks every registered guard before a dispatch, and `lots` never
   imports `finance`.
3. **Clusters never reference each other.** `apps/common/tests/test_architecture.py`
   walks every model's foreign keys and fails the build if one crosses. Where a
   cluster genuinely needs the other side — a claim built from an excursion, a
   policy over a shipment — it holds a code, not a key.
4. **One base unit, and money is minor units plus a currency.** Grams
   throughout; `MoneyModel` carries `amount_minor`, `currency` and the FX rate
   snapshotted on the row that used it.

## The API

Each cluster owns its own writes. `panels` owns the reads that legitimately
span clusters — a lot passport is quality, storage and finance on one page —
and it is the only module allowed to import across them.

| Path | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `POST /api/v1/auth/oneid/` | sign in (OneID; `stub` adapter until it is connected) |
| `POST /api/v1/auth/password/` | sign in with a username and password |
| `POST /api/v1/auth/refresh/` | exchange the httpOnly cookie for an access token |
| `POST /api/v1/auth/logout/`, `GET /auth/me/`, `GET /auth/personas/` | the rest of the session |
| `POST /api/v1/lots/` | register at the gate (idempotent) |
| `POST /api/v1/lots/{code}/{grade,split,reserve,dispatch,write-off}/` | the lifecycle |
| `GET  /api/v1/lots/{code}/verify-chain/` | recompute the hash chain |
| `POST /api/v1/quality/qc-records/`, `/quality/trials/{code}/observations/` | evidence |
| `POST /api/v1/storage/placements/`, `/readings/`, `/arrivals/{id}/weigh/` | the hub |
| `POST /api/v1/commercial/shipments/`, `/{code}/depart/`, `/exports/{code}/declaration/` | logistics and the border |
| `POST /api/v1/finance/applications/`, `/liens/`, `/claims/` (+ decisions) | money and risk |
| `POST /api/v1/documents/` | the vault |
| `POST /api/v1/storage/arrivals/` | a producer announces a delivery to the gate |
| `POST /api/v1/governance/grants/`, `/{id}/revoke/` | data-sharing consent |
| `GET  /api/v1/panels/search/` | what the box in the top bar looks through |
| `POST /api/v1/panels/notifications/{id}/read/` | the bell |
| `GET  /api/v1/panels/…` | everything the eight panels read |
| `GET  /api/v1/panels/public/lots/{code}/`, `/public/trials/{code}/` | open by design |
| `GET  /api/v1/assistant/`, `POST /assistant/ask/` | the website's assistant; also open |
| `POST /api/v1/assistant/panel/ask/` | the panels' assistant; session + `view`, and scoped |

**A lot is owned by one party and held by another.** `Lot.custody_party` is
who has it - the hub from the gate until it leaves - and `owner_party` is who
owns it throughout. Visibility needs both: keying on placement alone showed a
hub everything except the lots it had just taken in, which is exactly what its
gate, grading and put-away screens work on.

**Permissions are capability-based.** A view names the capability it needs —
`requires("capture")` — and never a role, so adding the thirty-eighth role
changes no view. Querysets are narrowed by `party_scope` before anything is
serialised, and a lot is visible through four routes: you own it, your facility
is holding it, you have a lien over it, or you insure it. Reads of a passport
are written to the audit log; "who looked at my lot" is a question this
platform has to answer.

## Sessions

OneID is the identity source and the platform stores no passwords for anyone
who comes through it. The access token is returned in the body for the client
to hold in memory; the refresh token is set as an **httpOnly, SameSite cookie**
scoped to `/api/v1/auth/` that JavaScript cannot read. A token in localStorage
is a finding in any bank's security review, and this platform faces banks.

`ONEID_ADAPTER=stub` resolves a seeded persona instead of a state identity and
returns `adapter: "stub"` in the session, which the sign-in screen prints. The
live adapter replaces one function in `apps/registry/auth.py`; no caller
changes. `POST /auth/password/` is the other door, and not a lesser one: it is how a
pilot runs before OneID is connected at all, and how the platform stays usable
when the state identity provider is down - which it will be. Those accounts are
created by `manage.py seed_accounts`, and the platform stores a hash, never the
password.

## The assistants

`apps/assistant` has no tables and serves two of them. They share the loop, the
stream and the seven rules in `brief.RULES`; they differ in who is asking, and
everything else follows from that.

### On the public website

Open to anybody. It can reach exactly two things: a brief describing the
programme - written down in `brief.py`, so what the product says about itself
is reviewable rather than buried in a log - and two tools that call
`/panels/public/lots/{code}/` and `/panels/public/trials/{code}/`. Those
endpoints are already open. The ceiling on what it can say about a lot is
therefore the same function that answers an anonymous browser: no owner, no
price, no lender, no lien. That is asserted in the tests, not promised in a
prompt.

### In the panels

`POST /assistant/panel/ask/`, behind a session and the `view` capability. Its
brief carries who is asking - their organisations, roles and capabilities, read
from the registry - and its four tools are scoped to them by the **same**
helpers the panel views use: `visible_lots`, `party_ids_of`, `is_platform`. One
place to get scoping right, not two.

| Tool | Reads | Scoped by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `find_lots` | one row per lot, with filters for status, produce, zone, lien and sell-by | `visible_lots` |
| `lot_passport` | the full passport for one lot | `visible_lots`, **and audited** |
| `find_zones` | capacity, fill, conditions, set points | facilities the caller's parties operate |
| `find_arrivals` | the gate queue | the yard you run, or the produce you sent |
| `find_excursions` | conditions out of band, and the evidence behind a write-off | your zone, or a lot you can see was in it |
| `find_qc` | quality checks, measurements, grades, lab documents | lots in `visible_lots` |
| `find_trials` | the ZEROCO trials, observed points and projection | **nothing - they are public** |
| `find_liens` | the lien register | liens over lots in `visible_lots` |
| `find_applications` | finance applications | applicant or lender party |
| `find_policies` | cover | insurer or holder party |
| `find_claims` | losses claimed | policy parties, or the lot |
| `find_shipments` | what is moving, and where to | carrier, seller, or a lot on board |
| `find_exports` | what was sold, to whom | seller party |
| `find_organisations` | the register | **platform roles only** - a refusal otherwise |

Three things worth knowing about it:

**A passport read is written to the audit log**, with the operator as actor and
`assistant: true` in the context, so an auditor can tell a read made through a
screen from one made through a question. A survey of forty lots is not audited
as forty passport reads - that would make the log unreadable, which is the same
as not having one.

**Where a panel screen is looser than the assistant, the assistant wins.** The
lien register view returns every lien to any authenticated caller; `find_liens`
returns liens over lots the caller can already see. Narrower than the screen is
a defect worth having. Wider is a breach.

**It reads and never writes.** There is no tool that grades a lot, places a
pallet, registers a lien or files a claim, and the brief tells it to name the
screen that does instead.

**One tool per question, and never a neighbouring one.** This is the rule the
brief spends the most words on, because breaking it is how the assistant
produced its only wrong answers. Given no tool for the gate queue it answered
from the lot table; given none for transit it said "nothing is in transit"
having looked at lot statuses while two shipments sat in the shipment table. A
missing tool does not read as missing - it reads as an answer. The fourteen
tools above exist so that the honest "I cannot see that" is needed rarely, and
the brief names those three failures so the model recognises the shape.

**Quantities are rendered in Python, not in the model's head.** Every tool
result runs through `_rendered`, which puts `valuation: "168000000.00 UZS"`
beside `valuation_minor: 16800000000` and `net_weight: "4200.0 kg"` beside
`net_weight_g`. The raw fields stay - rules 4 and 5 are the truth. This exists
because the model was doing the arithmetic itself and mostly getting it right:
asked in Russian what an insurer covered, it reported a lot valued at
168,000,000 UZS as 16,800,000, beside three figures it had divided correctly.
A money field whose currency cannot be found is left unrendered rather than
given a guessed one; this project spans UZS, USD and JPY.

### Switching them on

```sh
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...   # the only setting either of them needs
ASSISTANT_ADAPTER=off          # or switch both off with the key still in place
```

With no key, `GET /api/v1/assistant/` reports `available: false` with the
reason, and both widgets print one line saying the assistant is not connected.
That is the rule the OneID stub follows: a demonstration must never be able to
pass for the real thing.

Nothing is stored either side. A transcript is held by the browser, sent up
with each question because the Messages API is stateless, and written down
nowhere.

Both stream server-sent events - `delta`, `tool`, `done`, `blocked`, `error`.
An error carries a **code**, never a sentence: the product is read in three
languages and the wording belongs to the client, exactly as it does for lot
events.

Two things a deployment has to get right:

| Setting | Wrong looks like |
| --- | --- |
| `CACHES` | the rate limits are per gunicorn worker - three workers, three times the limit. Point `CACHES` at Redis or Memcached and they become one limit |
| proxy buffering | nginx buffers a proxied response by default and holds every token back until the answer is finished. The views send `X-Accel-Buffering: no`; a proxy that is not nginx needs its own equivalent |

## Ports

```python
from ports import get_port

get_port("lender").submit_application(application_id, amount_minor=...)
```

Callers name a port, never an adapter. Each ships with a manual adapter: the
request is recorded, `PortResult.state` comes back `pending_operator`, and an
operator resolves it from the admin after a phone call. `PortResult.accepted`
is `True` in that case — pending is success-so-far, not failure. Finance
applications, liens, claims, bookings, declarations and sensor batches all go
through them today.

## Database

PostgreSQL 16 is the target — JSONB for per-product QC specs and event
payloads, row-level security for party-scoped access, real transactions for
anything touching money or liens. Set `DATABASE_URL` to point at it. With that
unset the shell falls back to SQLite so it runs before a database has been
provisioned; do not ship on that. Two consequences of supporting both are
visible in the code and are commented where they are: excursions are matched to
lots in Python rather than with a `JSONField__contains` lookup, and
`ConditionReading` carries a plain integer key — it will outnumber every other
table a thousand to one and is the one to partition (or move to TimescaleDB)
first.

## Deployment

The backend serves the API and its own static files; the web client is a static
bundle that any web server can host. Nothing here needs a container to run.

```sh
# 1. the API
cp .env.example .env                      # then set the deployment block
#    DEBUG=False, a real DJANGO_SECRET_KEY, ALLOWED_HOSTS, DATABASE_URL,
#    CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS and CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS
.venv/bin/python manage.py check --deploy # must be clean before anything else
.venv/bin/python manage.py migrate
.venv/bin/python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
.venv/bin/python manage.py seed_reference
.venv/bin/python manage.py seed_demo      # pilot dataset; skip for a real one
.venv/bin/python manage.py seed_accounts  # prints the passwords once
.venv/bin/gunicorn config.wsgi:application --bind 127.0.0.1:8000 --workers 3

# 2. the web client
cd ../web
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://api.agrozanjir.uz npm run build   # -> web/dist
```

`web/dist` is served as static files, with **every unknown path rewritten to
`index.html`** - it is a single-page app, and a reader who reloads on
`/showroom/melon` gets a 404 from the web server otherwise.

Four things that are easy to get wrong, and what each looks like when it is:

| Setting | Wrong looks like |
| --- | --- |
| `VITE_API_BASE_URL` | Vite inlines it at **build** time; changing the API's address means building again |
| `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | every request fails in the browser and succeeds in `curl` |
| `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` | reads work, writes come back 403 |
| `REFRESH_COOKIE_SAMESITE` | signing in works, reloading the page signs you out - the cookie is `Lax` and the two hosts are not the same site |

With `DEBUG=False` the security settings switch on by themselves: TLS redirect,
HSTS, secure cookies, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, and the proxy header Django
needs to know a request arrived over HTTPS. `manage.py check --deploy` is the
gate - it must report no issues.

**PostgreSQL, not SQLite.** Set `DATABASE_URL`. The fallback exists so the
shell boots before a database is provisioned; two tables are written on every
lot movement and SQLite locks the file for each one.

## Not built yet

- **Live port adapters.** Every port runs its manual adapter. The seam is the
  deliverable; the integrations are phase 3.
- **Real OneID.** The stub resolves a seeded persona and says so.
- **Offline field capture.** The gate endpoint is idempotent, which is the half
  of it that belongs here; the PWA with its IndexedDB queue is not built.
- **Row-level security.** Scoping is enforced in the application layer only.
- **An assistant without a key.** `apps/assistant` is complete and tested, but
  a deployment that sets no `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` runs the website and the panels
  without it, and says so on the page.
